# Palindrome (Project Created for CS 301 - Data Structures and Algorithms)

This project was created with the intent of creating a recursive algorithm that will determine whether a number is a palindrome or not.

Of course, this is a version that can defintinely be improved on and will be improved on in the coming weeks.
